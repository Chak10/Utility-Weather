- Saturation Vapor Pressure formula for range (-100<=>0°C).
This is taken from:
ITS-90 Formulations for Vapor Pressure, Frostpoint Temperature, Dewpoint Temperature, and Enhancement Factors in the Range 100 to +100 C by Bob Hardy as published in "The Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Humidity & Moisture",Teddington, London, England, April 1998

- Saturation Vapor Pressure formula for range (273<=>678°K).
This is taken from:
the Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam by IAPWS (International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam), Erlangen, Germany, September 1997.
This is Equation (30) in Section 8.1 "The Saturation-Pressure Equation (Basic Equation)"
